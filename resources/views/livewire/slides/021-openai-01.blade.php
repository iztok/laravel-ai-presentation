### OpenAI PHP package

- Official unoffical integration with [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)
- Has [integration for Laravel](https://github.com/openai-php/laravel) (gives us config and facade)
- Supports all OpenAI endpoints (chat, image generation, embeddings, etc)
- Only works with OpenAI (and providers that implement OpenAI-compatible APIs, *maybe*)
